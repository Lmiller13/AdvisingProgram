# AdvisingProgram
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects being solved in this course was deciding and implementing the best data structure for an advising program, for a mock customer.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I aproached the problem by learning how to implement each data structure that we studied and their pros and cons. From here we mad a suggestion and implemented a data structure in our program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Using outside resourses such as stack overflow and others were very helpful when trying to figure out why items in my code were not working properly and look for potential fixes.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I think this class was especially helpful with this compared to some others because the final project didnt have any starter code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project made me further understand the importance of modularity in code, as I recycled some code from weekly assignments and modified them to fit the needs of the final project more closely.
